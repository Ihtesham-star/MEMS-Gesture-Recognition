## Project Status

This repository contains the complete source code from a **finished Master's thesis project** (defended April 2025, graduated June 2025).

## Purpose

This code is shared for:
- **Educational purposes**: Learning about gesture recognition and MEMS control
- **Research reference**: Understanding methodologies used in precision control systems
- **Code examples**: Demonstrating integration of computer vision with hardware control

## Hardware Limitations

⚠️ **Important Note**: The original hardware setup (MEMS mirror system) is no longer accessible as the thesis project is complete and the equipment was part of the university lab.

## How You Can Use This

### ✅ You CAN:
- Study the code and methodologies
- Use the algorithms in your own projects
- Adapt the gesture recognition system for other applications
- Reference this work in academic papers (with proper citation)
- Fork and modify for your own hardware setup
- Learn about TCP/IP communication between Python and MATLAB

### ❌ You CANNOT:
- Run the system without equivalent MEMS mirror hardware
- Expect active maintenance or feature additions
- Request new features for this specific project

## Questions & Discussions

While this is a completed project, I'm happy to:
- Answer questions about the methodologies
- Discuss the algorithms and approaches used
- Provide clarification on code implementation
- Share insights from the research process

**How to ask questions:**
- Open a GitHub Issue with your question
- Email: ihteshamul.hayat@nu.edu.kz
